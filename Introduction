 👋 Hi, I’m @ArijitChow, I am a first year student at the University of Waterloo.
         I am currently studying Computer Science.
 👀 I’m interested in many aspects of programming such as cloud computing, machine learning and UI design. 
      I hope to learn more about these topics as I take on challenges and build projects
 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals needed to understand machine learning such as regression techniques
      that have a large role in supervised learning
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can use machine learning (or not) to provide further assistance
      to doctors and medical practitioners during the pandemic
